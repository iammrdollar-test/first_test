# LITTLE LADY - Ed Sheeran (ft. Mikill Pane)

[Verse 1: Mikill Pane]
Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

[Hook 1: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
 

[Verse 2: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back?
She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn

[Hook]

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
 

[Verse 3: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped
And all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday
 

[Hook 2: Ed Sheeran]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die
